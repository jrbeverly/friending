## Summary 

Friending is an online dating, friendship, and social networking mobile application that features user-created questionnaires. Friending has two primary features: joining groups to find people similar to you or registering for events happening in your local area.  Friending is a prototype built with the Proto.io application prototyping tool.

The Friending prototype was built as part of a requirements specification project.  The requirements specification project involved constructing a user manual based on a project vision document as well as a set of user requirements.  The User Manual was designed with the goal of _deceiving_ the reader into believing that the application actually existed.  Proto.io was the perfect tool to accomplish this goal in order to ensure that the presentation of Friending in the user manual is visually consistent and believable.  Proto.io provides a fully-interactive high-fidelity prototype that look and work similar to the described application in the user manual.

## Proto io

Proto.io is a web service to create fully-interactive high-fidelity prototypes that look and work exactly like your app should. No coding required.  Using Proto.io you can quickly design and prototype design ideas.  Proto.io was the perfect choice for the project, as it produced both a believable mobile application, as well as a high-fidelity prototype that could be used to demo the application concept.

## Generated

The code provided in this repository is generated by Proto.io using the [Export to HTML](https://support.proto.io/hc/en-us/articles/220705787-Sharing-and-Collaboration-Exporting-and-downloading-offline) feature.  The exported `index.html` file does not contain the rendered HTML pages of the prototype. The prototype pages are rendered by the Proto.io rendering engine (Javascript) which means that you should not modify any exported HTML code as this may break the presentation and functionality of your prototype.

As each exported prototype uses randomly generated file names for assets, this can mean that the versioning of assets is not always consistent, nor legible.  The interaction code for a prototype is controlled by a minimized javascript, so it too is not legible.

The code has been altered slightly to switch the generated `frame.html` and `index.html` to make use of the device skin wrapper of the prototype.  This presents a visually appealing prototype for demonstration to potential users.
