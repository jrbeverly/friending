**Friending** is an online dating, friendship, and social networking mobile application that features user-created questionnaires and multiple choice questions. Friending has two primary features: joining groups to find people similar to you or registering for events happening in
your local area.  Friending is a mobile app prototype built with Proto.io mobile app prototyping tool.

## Purpose

The **Friending** prototype was built as part of the design of a requirements specification project.  **Friending** was built for a user manual (UM), in order to ensure that the screenshots in the user manual were visually consistent and believable.
The User Manual was designed with the goal of _deceiving_ the reader into believing that the application actually existed.  Proto.io was the perfect tool to accomplish this goal.

## Proto io
Proto.io is a web service to create fully-interactive high-fidelity prototypes that look and work exactly like your app should. No coding required.  Using Proto.io you can quickly design and prototype design ideas.  

## Generated

The code provided in this repository is generated by proto.io using [Export to HTML](https://support.proto.io/hc/en-us/articles/220705787-Sharing-and-Collaboration-Exporting-and-downloading-offline).  The exported `index.html` file does not contain the rendered HTML pages of the prototype. The prototype pages are rendered by the Proto.io rendering engine (Javascript) which means that you should not modify any exported HTML code as this may break the presentation and functionality of your prototype.

As each exported prototype uses randomly generated file names for assets, this can mean that the versioning of assets is not always consistent, nor legible.  The interaction code for a prototype is controlled by a minimized javascript, so it too is not legible.

The code has been altered slightly to switch the generated `frame.html` and `index.html` to allow that when opened in a browser the prototype is presented with a device skin wrapper.
